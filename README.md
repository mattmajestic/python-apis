# Python API Frameworks with Docker 🚀

This repository is a starter kit for building web applications using three popular Python web frameworks: Django, Flask, and FastAPI.

## 📁 Django Folder

Django is a high-level Python web framework for building robust web applications.
It emphasizes reusability, "batteries-included," and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
To get started with Django, navigate to the django folder.

## 📁 Flask Folder

Flask is a micro web framework that is simple, lightweight, and easy to use.
It offers flexibility and is an excellent choice for small to medium-sized web applications.
To get started with Flask, head to the flask folder.

`docker pull mattmajestic/flask-api` from Terminal

## 📁 FastAPI Folder

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
It is asynchronous and easy to use, making it an ideal choice for building RESTful APIs.
To get started with FastAPI, explore the fastapi folder.
